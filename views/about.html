          <h1>Hi, I'm Seetha Lakshmi!</h1>
          <p>I'm passionate web developer with a penchant for creating engaging online experiences. 
          Currently residing in the beautiful city of Utrecht, I share my life with my wonderful husband and our two kids.</p>
           
      <p>My educational journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering,
         which I proudly earned in 2012. Since then, I've been immersed in the dynamic world of web development, 
         honing my skills and crafting digital wonders that range from static websites to expansive, feature-rich platforms.
          I find immense joy in bringing ideas to life through code and design.</p>
      
      <p>In my professional journey spanning over 4 years, I've had the privilege of working on a diverse array of projects. 
        From developing robust websites that seamlessly blend functionality and aesthetics, 
        to creating captivating UI designs for mobile applications, I've embraced every opportunity to learn, grow, and innovate.</p>
      
      <p>My expertise extends to the WordPress ecosystem, where I've mastered the art of building customized websites that cater to unique business needs.
         WooCommerce, with its e-commerce prowess, is another realm where I've left my mark, enabling businesses to establish and flourish in the online marketplace.</p>
          <p>
            In this immersive program, I'm delving deeper into web development and design, fueled by a desire to elevate my skills and embrace the latest technologies. As I navigate this transformative experience,
             I am not only enhancing my technical expertise but also cultivating problem-solving abilities and collaborative spirit.
             I've taken a bold step forward by enrolling in the esteemed Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp.</p>
